<p>This sankey diagram visualizes how expenditures directed towards the Sustainable Development Goal 16 can be measured using the OECD's <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1">ODA Data</a>. The chords connect the Goal's individual <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16">indicators</a> with the respective <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm">purpose codes</a> of the OECD <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/dacandcrscodelists.htm">Creditor Reporting System</a>.</p>
